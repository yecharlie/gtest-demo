# gtest-demo (yecharlie's revision)

This fork adjusts parts of naming convertion, moves googletest building's results along side with tests' as Google Test official demo shows (whatever, just a style), by the way adds some frequently used configurations of CMake.

Additionally, some parts of CMake 's configurations are removed for persol interest. (GNU standards & coverage)

# gtest-demo (original)

C/C++ unit test demo using [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest) deployed to
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/bast/gtest-demo/builds) with test coverage
deployed to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/bast/gtest-demo).

This demo uses the approach presented by Craig Scott in https://crascit.com/2015/07/25/cmake-gtest/.


## How to build this demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bast/gtest-demo.git
cd gtest-demo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```


## Running the tests

Either using `ctest`:
```
$ ctest

Running tests...
Test project /home/user/gtest-demo/build
    Start 1: unit
1/1 Test #1: unit .............................   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.00 sec
```

Or directly using `unit_tests`:
```
$ ./bin/unit_tests

[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
